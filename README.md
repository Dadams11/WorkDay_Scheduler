# Work Day Scheduler 🗓️

A dynamic and responsive calendar application that allows users to save events for each hour of a standard business day. This project uses **jQuery**, **Day.js**, and **localStorage** to deliver real-time time tracking and data persistence right in the browser.

## 📌 Description

This calendar helps busy professionals plan their day efficiently. It color-codes each hourly block to visually indicate whether the time is in the past, present, or future. Users can click into any time block to enter a task and hit save — the input persists across sessions using `localStorage`.
